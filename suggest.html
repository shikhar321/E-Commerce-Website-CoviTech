<h2 style="color:white;">What is COVID-19?</h2>
<h3><p>
COVID-19 is the disease caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.  WHO first learned of this new virus on 31 December 2019, following a report of a cluster of cases of ‘viral pneumonia’ in Wuhan, People’s Republic of China.

<h3><p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are</p>
<ul><li>Fever</li><li>Dry cough</li><li>Fatigue</li></ul>
<p>Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include:</p>
<ul><li>Loss of taste or smell,</li><li>Nasal congestion,</li><li>Conjunctivitis (also known as red eyes)</li><li>Sore throat,</li><li>Headache,</li><li>Muscle or joint pain,</li><li>Different types of skin rash,</li><li>Nausea or vomiting,</li><li>Diarrhea,</li><li>Chills or dizziness.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p></h3>

<h3><p>Symptoms of severe COVID-19 disease include:</p>
<ul><li>Shortness of breath,</li><li>Loss of appetite,</li><li>Confusion,</li><li>Persistent pain or pressure in the chest,</li><li>High temperature (above 38 C).</li></ul>
<ul><li>Irritability,</li><li>Confusion,</li><li>Reduced consciousness (sometimes associated with seizures),</li><li>Anxiety,</li><li>Depression,</li><li>Sleep disorders,</li><li>More severe and rare neurological complications such as strokes, brain inflammation, delirium and nerve damage.</li></ul>
<p>People of all ages who experience fever and/or cough associated with difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, or loss of speech or movement should seek medical care immediately. If possible, call your health care provider, hotline or health facility first, so you can be directed to the right clinic.</p></h3>

<hr class="new5">
<h2 style="color:white;">What happens to people who get COVID-19?</h2>
<h3><p>
Among those who develop symptoms, most (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. About 15% become seriously ill and require oxygen and 5% become critically ill and need intensive care.

Complications leading to death may include respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, thromboembolism, and/or multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys.

In rare situations, children can develop a severe inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after infection.
</p></h3>
<hr class="new5">
<h2 style="color:white;">Who is most at risk of severe illness from COVID-19?</h2>
<h3><p>
People aged 60 years and over, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, obesity or cancer, are at higher risk of developing serious illness. 

However, anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. 
</p></h3>
<hr class="new5">
<h2 style="color:white;">How can we protect others and ourselves if we don't know who is infected?</h2>
<h3><p>
Stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, especially when distancing cannot be maintained, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds and close contact, regularly cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where you live and work. Do it all!
</p></h3>
<hr class="new5">
<h2 style="color:white;">When should I get a test for COVID-19?</h2>
<h3><p>
Anyone with symptoms should be tested, wherever possible. People who do not have symptoms but have had close contact with someone who is, or may be, infected may also consider testing – contact your local health guidelines and follow their guidance.  

While a person is waiting for test results, they should remain isolated from others. Where testing capacity is limited, tests should first be done for those at higher risk of infection, such as health workers, and those at higher risk of severe illness such as older people, especially those living in seniors’ residences or long-term care facilities.
</p></h3>
<hr class="new5">
<h2 style="color:white;">What test should I get to see if I have COVID-19?</h2>
<h3><p>
In most situations, a molecular test is used to detect SARS-CoV-2 and confirm infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most commonly used molecular test. Samples are collected from the nose and/or throat with a swab. Molecular tests detect virus in the sample by amplifying viral genetic material to detectable levels. For this reason, a molecular test is used to confirm an active infection, usually within a few days of exposure and around the time that symptoms may begin. 
</p></h3>
<hr class="new5">
<h2 style="color:white;">How long does it take to develop symptoms?</h2>
<h3><p>
The time from exposure to COVID-19 to the moment when symptoms begin is, on average, 5-6 days and can range from 1-14 days. This is why people who have been exposed to the virus are advised to remain at home and stay away from others, for 14 days, in order to prevent the spread of the virus, especially where testing is not easily available.
</p></h3>
<hr class="new5">
<h2 style="color:white;">What should I do if I have COVID-19 symptoms?</h2>
<h3><p>
If you have any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, call your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline for instructions and find out when and where to get a test, stay at home for 14 days away from others and monitor your health.

If you have shortness of breath or pain or pressure in the chest, seek medical attention at a health facility immediately. Call your health care provider or hotline in advance for direction to the right health facility.

If you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever, seek medical care if you have a fever.

If local guidance recommends visiting a medical centre for testing, assessment or isolation, wear a medical mask while travelling to and from the facility and during medical care. Also keep at least a 1-metre distance from other people and avoid touching surfaces with your hands.  This applies to adults and children.
